Author: Bruce Cropley (cropleyb at yahoo.com.au)
Usage: BCSolve082 [-dQS] [-s piece_set] [-F sols] [-ffigurefile] [-m model]

   -d: Show startup debugging (initial # moves per piece)
   -Q: Don't show solutions found. (for testing)
   -S: Show solution statistics
   -s: [SEDB]: Use which piece set
       SOMA, Extended SOMA, Double SOMA, Bedlam
       Usually defaults using the number of cubelets in the figure.
   -F: sols: Calculate a given number of solutions. Default is all.
   -f: figurefile: Solve a figure described in the figure file.
       Default is a cube. (Soma and Bedlam)
   -m: Model to solve within the file.
       Defaults to the first in the file.
       The solver just searches for the first line starting
       with / that contains the given model name.

Example:   BCSolve082 -ss -fcubit3.fig >cubit3.res
Included in the zip file are a few sample figure template files; these are example inputs to the -f argument. 

It uses the number of cubelets in the figure to determine which piece set to use:
27: Soma
40: Soma plus
54: Double soma
64: Bedlam
